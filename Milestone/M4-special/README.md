#### Description
Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a rising methodology to test and check your code. In BDD, whatever developers write must go into Given-When-Then steps, and thus covers all possible test cases and can be easily modified to accommodate more. 

In BDD, users (business analysts, product owners) first write scenarios or acceptance tests that describes the behavior of the system from the customers' perspective, for review and sign-off by the project owners before developers write their code.

Cucumber tool offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. It is more like writing documentation. It has five main benefits:

* helps to involve business stakeholders to easily understand code
* focuses on end-user experience
* style of writing tests allow for easier reuse of code in the tests
* quick and easy set up and execution
* efficient tool for testing
