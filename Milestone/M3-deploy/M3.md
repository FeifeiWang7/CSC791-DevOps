# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT

We've learn how to deploy a web app *locally* using a green-blue deployment strategy.
In this MILESTONE, we will extend our deployment pipeline to support deployment to *real* machine, and using a canary release strategy.

### Properties

Your pipeline should support the following properties.

* The ability to configure a deployment environment *automatically*, using a configuration management tool, such as ansible, or configured using vagrant/docker.

* The ability to deploy a *self-contained/built* application to the deployment environment.  That is, this action should occur after a build step in your pipeline.

* The deployment must occur on an actual remote machine/VM (e.g. AWS, droplet, VCL), and not a local VM.

* The ability to perform a canary release.

* The ability to monitor the deployed application for alerts/failures (using at least 2 metrics).

### Evalution

* Automatic deployment environment configuration: 20%
* Deployment of binaries created by build step: 20%
* Remote deployment: 20%
* Canary releasing: 20%
* Canary analysis: 20%

### Submission

Email a link to your TA with a link to a repository that includes

your code,
a README.md, describing how your component meets each property.

Due Monday, April 13th @ midnight.
