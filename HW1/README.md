A service I learned about is a web service called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) that is aimed at providing resizable compute capacity in the cloud. There are five advantages of using Amazon EC2. First, Amazon EC2 grant users with complete control of the computing resources. Second, scaling capacity is fast since obtain and boot new server instances can be finished in minutes. Third, users can only pay for the capacity that they actually use. Fourth, there are tools for developers and system administrators to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios. Five, scaling capacity and balancing load is automatic and seamless.
