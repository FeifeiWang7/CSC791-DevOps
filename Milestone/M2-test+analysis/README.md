# Test_Analysis

I worked with Jesse on this milestone.

### Test

We use Istanbul as the coverage tool to help cover javascript unit tests.

The setup follows workshop4 and homework2.

Run Istanbul

	node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover test.js

To ease analysis, we save the results to test.txt.

We use [JsHint](http://jshint.com/docs/) as the static analysis tool.

Install JsHint

        npm install jshint -g

Run JsHint

        jshint subject.js

To ease analysis, we save the results to analysis.txt.

To make JsHint omit certain errors, modify [options](http://jshint.com/docs/options/) of JsHint.

For example, if we want to omit the error that uses '==' to compare with 'null', we can create a .jshintrc file and put the following JsHint options into it.

	{
	  "eqnull": true,
	}

To reject a commit if it fails a minimum testing criteria, we need to config the Github hook by editing .git/hooks/pre-commit. We modify the pre-commit file to run our own script test.sh when a commit is commited in this git repository.

So the content of pre-commit is simple

	#!/bin/sh
	# Refuse to commit files with if failed coverage test by 50% or failed certain analysis rules#
	echo "call test.sh"
	sh ./test.sh


### Analysis

#### Less than 50% coverage of any kind in Coverage Report
We have used the Shell Script to get the result from test.txt, as mentioned in Test Section. If there is some coverage which is lower than 50%. We deny that commit and output the error infomation.
The following are the sample result:

	Branches Coverage is less than  50 %.

#### Failed the Analysis Criteria 
We have used the Shell Script to get the result from analysis.txt, as mentioned in JsHint Section. If there is certain errors which are found by jshint, we will deny the commit and show the error infomation, in our case is the "missing semicolon". 
The following are the sample result:

##Result
If you passed all the criteria, you will be able to commit, as the following shows.

	Jesses-MacBook-Air:Test_Analysis jessexu$ git add -A
	Jesses-MacBook-Air:Test_Analysis jessexu$ git commit -m "test2"
	call test.sh
	Check Commit Script start now
